### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniel, and since early on, I've harbored a burning passion for web development, as well as electronic games, a true journey that captivated me. Navigating through a sea of possibilities, I undoubtedly found myself lost at the beginning. The flame of technology was burning, leading me to delve into various computer courses. But my foray into the digital world didn't start there... 

...as early as 2002, I was already forging the first websites in collaboration with friends, a time when the internet was like uncharted territory.

I haven't been contributing much on GitHub, to be honest. I never truly appreciated the platform's potential, which in hindsight, was a missed opportunity. Now, I understand that GitHub serves as a crucial gateway to numerous opportunities and a platform to showcase one's skills. While I've predominantly worked independently, I did have a brief stint in a team during my school days, where I first delved into the world of coding. It was during this time that I uttered the iconic greeting to my current digital abode: "Hello World!"
